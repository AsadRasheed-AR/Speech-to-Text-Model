# Speech-to-Text-Model
This repository contains a notebook that contains code for the speech-to-text model trained on LJSpeech dataset. Additionally a pretrained model also uploaded in the same same repository so a user can load the pretrained model and further train the model to get better results. 

NOTE: Change the model name in notebook while loading a pretrained model. The model size is greater than 300 MBs so I uploaded it in the google drive which can be accessed using the link given below:
